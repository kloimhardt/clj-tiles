     [:p "We start by creating a function Path-of-a-Free-Particle. Newtons first law states that in some inertial frame of reference, an object continues to move in space at a constant velocity. This movement takes time, so our function depends on time. It returns a vector of two elements because we choose our path to live in two dimensions."]

In familiar notation, the path is denoted by:
