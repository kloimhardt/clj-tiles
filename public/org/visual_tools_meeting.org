* re-clojure
** 1/2/3
** 9
** II
** Lagrangian
** question about feedback
presented at re-clojure conference. Only buildt in puzzles.

* wordle

* FDG Book
** mentat .org
** open via parser
** hint anything can be the URL

* click through (don't solve)

* solve first mechanically + shuffle
puzzles are solvable mechanically

* End of chapter
show the last page "End of chapter" trick of the 4Clojure Tutorial to unlock all solutions

* show complicated #17
e.g. I have no way of understnaidng #17, If I shuffle it, it is hopeless.
but I can still solve it and try to start to understand or remember in a first step

* #16 +inspect -missing-equation-numbers
** inspect shows what book does not
** but missing equation numbers
** keep .pdf handy (open pdf)
In the text #16 it sais they do not want to show the messy results, but we can do it using inspect

* show uniteresting #6
not every puzzle is interesting: #5&6 (only adds tex-equation)

* Mahoney: blogs do not show workspace

* pendulum click through (don't solve)
if not solved, need to complete a puzzle, reward is the solution of the next

* solve first

* driven pendulum + #120 black
show the path-of-a-free-particle black coloring, code as a story,
relation to Mark Mahony

* Questions
** four.org -no-story
show four.org as contrast to the FDG book: it has no story, so claim that this maybe is not so interesting
** free particle #126
show inspect-tutorial
