* ---------- re-clojure
** 1/2/3 + 9 + II + Lagrangian
Dylan poems have feedback, II does not (like mostly all others),
Lagrangian has description like a book 

* ---------- FDG
** FDG hompage + mentat.org

** URL at will + click through (don't solve)
when run, sometimes no interesting result. Improved in Pendulum section.

** solve first with colors + wordle

** End of chapter

** show complicated #17 + solve + shuffle
puzzles are complicated because automatically generated.
Improved on by hand made puzzles presented in Pendulum section.

** #16 +inspect -missing-equation-numbers (open pdf)

** show uniteresting #6

* ---------- Pendulum
** Mahoney: blogs do not show workspace

** pendulum click through to end + unlock

** click through again

** driven pendulum + #120 black

* ---------- Questions
** For whom is it?
1) Armchair physicists
2) anyone who wants to live code his .org file in front of audience

** Compared to scratch?
Parsons puzzles, not creating programs

** - four.org -no-story
show four.org as contrast to the FDG book:
it has no story, so claim that this maybe is not so interesting

** - free particle #126
show inspect-tutorial
