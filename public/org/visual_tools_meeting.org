* Ideas for visual tools meetup 2.7.22

presented at re-clojure conference. Only buildt in puzzles.

** open book + .org + Mahoney

** load chapter one + click through
if not solved, need to complete a puzzle, reward is the solution of the next

** solve first mechanically
puzzles are solvable mechanically

** End of chapter
show the last page "End of chapter" trick of the 4Clojure Tutorial to unlock all solutions

** show complicated #17
e.g. I have no way of understnaidng #17, If I shuffle it, it is hopeless.
but I can still solve it and try to start to understand or remember in a first step

** #16 +inspect -missing-equation-numbers
In the text #16 it sais they do not want to show the messy results, but we can do it using inspect
-> cljtiles added value is 1) puzzle + wordle green coloring 2) inspect
-> but is only an add on for a good traditional book
User should Download the original pdfs as these are the original and be consulted when in doubt
We have no equation numbers for example

** show uniteresting #6
not every puzzle is interesting: #5&6 (only adds tex-equation)

** four.org -no-story
show four.org as contrast to the FDG book: it has no story, so claim that this maybe is not so interesting

** driven pendulum + #122 black + mahoney
show the path-of-a-free-particle black coloring, code as a story,
relation to Mark Mahony

** free particle #126
show inspect-tutorial
